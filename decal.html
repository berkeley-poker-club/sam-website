                <br />
                <br />
                This class will be impossible to succeed in without active
                participation in class and attendance to learn the material. It
                will be a very laid-back and open atmosphere so students should
                be encouraged to discuss topics.
                <br /><br />
                Attending over 75% of sessions: 30%
                <br /><br />
                Attending over 62.5% of sessions: 26%
                <br /><br />
                Attending over 50% of sessions: 23%
                <br /><br />
                Attendance below 50%: proportional to attendance. For example,
                25% attendance earns 25% * 30% = 7.5%.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Playing Session Attendance (25%)</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                We will have short sessions after lecture where we will practice
                using play money. Total hand count and player activity will be
                logged to find weaknesses and ensure student engagement.
                <br /><br />
                Attending over 75% of sessions: 30%

                Attending over 62.5% of sessions: 26%
                <br /><br />
                Attending over 50% of sessions: 23%
                <br /><br />
                Attendance below 50%: proportional to attendance. For example,
                25% attendance earns 25% * 30% = 7.5%.

              <p>
                <strong>Homework (30%)</strong>
                <br /><br />
                Throughout the semester, there will be weekly assignments that
                should take at most an hour. Homework assignments will be graded
                entirely based on effort and completion, with examples given of
                what constitutes a reasonable effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Final Project (20%)</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The course will have a final assignment requiring you to analyze
                some of the hands that you played during sessions over the
                course of the semester. Similarly to the Homework, it will be
                graded based on effort and completion, with examples of hand
                analysis provided.
                <br /><br />
                In other words, if you attend a majority of lectures and playing
                sessions and complete a majority of assignments, you will pass
                the course. While not for a grade, we will also have short
                weekly reading assignments. Please contact us regarding time
                conflicts or needed accommodations for absences. We promise to
                be reasonable and do not want grades to be a concern for any
                student engaging with the course.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Course Description</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The purpose of this course is to teach students poker
                fundamentals, both to help them improve at the game and learn
                wider applications of the game theory found in poker. While we
                believe students of all skill levels will benefit from the
                course, it is primarily targeted at beginners and those with an
                advanced understanding of the game may already be familiar with
                most material.
                <br /><br />
                The course will focus on 6-max No Limit Texas Hold'em, the most
                popular variant of Poker played today. We will begin by covering
                the rules of the game, basic strategic principles, before diving
                into the mathematics and heuristics used by strong players.
                While not the focus of the course, we will additionally briefly
                touch on the psychological aspects of poker, including some
                common tells and reads found in live play. Specific topics will
                include (but are not limited to): Position, Preflop Ranges, Pot
                Odds, Equity, Bankroll Management, Blocker Effects,
                Polarization, Exploitative Adjustments, Tells.
                <br /><br />
                Learning poker theory is beneficial for reasons outside of
                improving at the game. Thinking about decisions in terms of
                their expected value while minimizing variance is a valuable
                skill with many applications in statistics, mathematics, game
                theory, economics, investing and finance.
                <br /><br />
                Poker skill is highly valued by many financial firms, with
                relevant material often appearing on interviews and books on
                poker theory often finding their way on to the reading list for
                new hires. Carnegie Mellon and Facebook have put major effort
                (and have succeeded) into creating Superhuman Poker AI due to
                far reaching applications to other imperfect information
                systems. While we will focus solely on poker itself, a strong
                understanding of poker remains very useful off the table.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4>
              <p>
                For success in this course, it is recommended that you have
                completed a lower division probability course (STAT 20/STAT
                21/STAT 88/UGBA 88) as there will be many fundamental
                statistical concepts covered. If you have not taken any of these
                classes before, you are still welcome to take the course, but be
                aware you may find some of the material more difficult.
                <br /><br />
                It is also strongly recommended that students come to the course
                familiar with the rules of Texas Hold'em we will cover the rules
                but starting from no basis will be more difficult.<br /><br />
                To succeed in this course, we highly recommend students attend
                every lecture as content is cumulative and it may be difficult
                to follow if you are behind on past material.
                <br /><br />The only way to improve at poker is through focused
                play and study.
